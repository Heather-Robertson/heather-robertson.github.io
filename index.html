          I am currently a member of the Design Engineering Masterâ€™s cohort at Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design. 
          My work focuses on making as a liberatory practice, motivated by the (dis)ability and queer liberation movements. 
          I approach this subject both from a theoretical, academic perspective and through the concrete practice of making, often with robotics as my physical medium. 
          My work particularly centers humor and play, recognizing joy as a foremost form of resistance. <br><br>
          For instance: <br>
          - I researched, designed, built, and programmed a series of robots that bring play into exposures in therapeutic PTSD treatment.<br>
          - I designed, constructed, and coded a tool to make creative expression through makeup artistry more accessible and sustainable.<br>
          - I drafted and fabricated a game to promote cross-cultural dialogue and learning.<br><br>

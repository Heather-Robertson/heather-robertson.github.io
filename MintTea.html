      <p>A hot summer afternoon – 90+ degrees in the southern sun, and humid to boot. 
        We’ve been running around the crick bed all day, catching salamanders and playing wedding. Potion brewing time now, we seem to have decided. 
        It’s a favorite pastime of ours lately, in spite of the fact our potions tend towards the inedible side – whatever spring onions and dandelions we can get our hands on (some lemmonsorrow if we’re lucky) muddled together with a stick before being mixed into an old paintbrush mug full of hose water.
        Not this time, though. Diana has a surprise. Her mom says the mint is ready to harvest. 
        She leads me over to the edge of the driveway, where leaves spill out onto the pavement vying for prime afternoon sun. 
        She bends down and plucks a leaf before popping it into her mouth. I follow suit. The taste is bitter, green, and metallic but then sweet and refreshing. 
        I’m not sure how I feel about it. She says we’re going to make mint tea. <br>
        We get to plucking the leaves for our tea. “Pick the dark green leaves,” she says, “nothing with black or rust on it.” 
        Later in the summer, I’ll learn to avoid the stems that have started to flower. We place the leaves in piles on the driveway while we work, until we’ve gathered several handfuls’ worth.
        We form the bellies of our shirts into makeshift hammocks to get it all inside in one trip. Then it all gets dumped into the sink. 
        We rinse each leaf, just for a second – we don’t want to risk losing any of the flavor, and then we begin hanging the leaves up to dry. 
        Little clusters: 5 or 6 leaves on each clothespin, all attached to a string hanging by the kitchen window. 
        I can still see the prisms and the leaves hanging there together, casting their ballet of rainbows and shadows onto the far wall. <br>
        Twenty-or-so days later, it’s finally time. We pull down all of the leaves, now brittle. 
        Diana’s mom starts the flame on the stove, but Diana is old enough to do the rest by herself now. 
        We fill the pot with a little more water than we perhaps ought to, but it doesn’t turn out to be a problem. 
        We dance around the kitchen, impatiently waiting for the water to boil. At eight years old, downtime is still a burden to us. 
        What might as well have been another twenty days passed, a simmer breaks out. 
        Diana turns off the heat while I grab the little mugs down from the cabinet. Another minute yet to wait, though. 
        Pour the water while it’s too hot and the leaves will burn, killing the flavor. 
        I put 10-15 leaves in each mug, and once the water has cooled, we pour it over the leaves. Waiting for the tea to steep feels much faster. 
        We watch the water change color, start to mix in the sugar, and occasionally even dare to sniff our creation. At long last, it’s time to taste. 
        How a hot tea can be such a refreshing drink in the peak of Tennessee summer, I still don’t know. 
        The taste is sweet, cool, succulent – it flows down my throat but lingers in my mouth all the same. 
        I share a look with Diana. We silently agree: this is the nectar gifted to us by our gentle mother, this is our bond with the land and each other, this is home. <br>
        <!-- Today, 13 years later and 800-odd miles away, our sentiments hold true. We carry eternally a reminder of that sweet mother’s gift: <br>
